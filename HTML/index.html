        <h3> The beginning of modern technology could be seen in early 1800s – the start of industrial revolution and since then there has been no looking back.

Gone are the days of waiting for months to receive a letter from your friend or relative residing in a distant place. At the click of some buttons you can talk to anyone sitting in a remote part of the world. Earlier people used to flock to library for research work or pleasure reading which has now been replaced with e books and search engines.

<u> Some 100 years back, people could not predict the incoming hurricane</u>, its position and time of attack but now anyone with a mobile phone can find these details and interpret it accurately. The outdoor activities have now been replaced with computers and Play Station. Now a days, kids prefer spending time on what their virtual friends are up to rather than spending quality time with their family or friends.

Technology is advancing with a speed of light making it difficult to cope up with. It has transformed our lives and has turned the world into a global village. Its potential is limitless and awaits great discoveries in the near future.</h3>
